    "text": "3 A few miscellaneous things about R and Quarto\n\n3.1 About R\n\nR is case sensitive\n\nmean is not the same as Mean\nThe object b is not the same as the object B\n\nExtra returns don’t matter\n\nExtra spaces generally don’t matter either\nI often add extra spaces, tabs, and returns to make the code more readable\n\nThe assignment operator is &lt;-\n\n“Put whatever is on the right side in the object named on the left side”\n\nSometimes, equal isn’t equal\n\nIf you’re talking about assigning something to a value, you can use =\nIf you want to compare two values and make a decision based on it, you use ==\n\nThere isn’t a standard, widely-used naming convention for variables, so you should pick something and try to be consistent\n\nIn general, variable names must start with a letter – no numbers or special characters\nThere are some options for multi-word variable naming\n\nvariablename: Just smush it all together\nvariableName or VariableName: Camel case\nvariable_name or Variable_Name: Snake case\nvariable-name or Variable-Name: Kebab case\n\nIn general, make the variable names as short as possible while keeping each name unique\n\n\n\n\n3.2 About Quarto\n\nLook at the top of the Quarto file. The section with --- at the top and bottom. This is the YAML (pronounced “yam-ull”). It provides options for the overall document.\n\ntitle: is pretty obvious\nformat: tells R which output format to produce when you knit the document together\nThis is an html document, but you can specify different or multiple output formats, like both HTML and PDF\n\nThere are additional options that are specific to this format\nself-contained: true and self-contained-math: true make sure that any additional files that are created, like figures are part of the HTML file. If I didn’t include this and sent you to the HTML file, the figures would be missing.\nhtml-math-method: katex is an option about the equations and math text. It’s probably not necessary, but I include it anyway.\nnumber-sections: true and toc: true produce the table of contents on the right side of this page and number the sections and sub-sections (remember headings and organization?) to make it easier to navigate\ncode-tools: true adds the &lt;/&gt; Code button at the top that shows the code that made this page. You can copy the code (using the little “Copy to clipboard” icon in the upper right) and paste it right into R\ncode-block-bg: true and code-block-border-left: \"#31BAE9\" make the code chunks a little more noticable – they blended into the background too much otherwise.\nThe YAML is one of the few places that spacing matters. Note how each sub-option is indented more than it’s over-option. If you don’t get this right, the file won’t run\nRead more about YAML options here\n\n\nYou can label each code chunk in the document\n\nThis is a very smart thing to do – but I don’t do it consistently :(\nIf you have an error, R will tell you which chunk has the problem\n\nIf the chunks are named, it will use the name so it’s easy to find\nIf they’re not named, it will tell you something like “Unnamed chunk 52”, which is less helpful\n\nName your chunks with #| label: name-of-this-chunk\n\nSee the setup chunk above – that’s just its name, “setup”\n\n\nThere are other options for code chunks. Here are some useful ones\n\necho: true: Repeats the code in the output\nwarning: false: Suppress any warnings from R (not recommended)\neval: false: Don’t run this code, just print it (useful for teaching)\nFor any of these, you can swap from true to false or vice versa and get the opposite effect\nfig-cap: \"My figure caption is cool\": Adds a caption to the figure produced in that chunk – useful for accessibility\nMore info here and here"

You’ll almost always be using external data (not internal R data) in your own research, so this is really important.\n\n\n6.2 Data from a package\nSome packages contain data. We will use the gapminder dataset from the gapminder package. Another great source of dataset is the datasets package, which includes commonly used datasets such as iris and mtcars. (Note that if you want to use iris or mtcars, you’ll need to load it – it is installed with R by default, so you don’t need to install it.)\nTo load a dataset, use the data() function\n\ndata(\"gapminder\")"

It shows the number of rows and columns, and summarizes some basic info about each variable (like whether it’s a number or character variable and the possible values).\n\nstr(gapminder)\n\ntibble [1,704 × 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels \"Afghanistan\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ year     : int [1:1704] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...\n $ lifeExp  : num [1:1704] 28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...\n $ pop      : int [1:1704] 8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 14880372 12881816 13867957 16317921 22227415 ...\n $ gdpPercap: num [1:1704] 779 821 853 836 740 ...\n\n\n\n\n7.4 glimpse() function\nThe glimpse() function is in the dplyr package in the tidyverse. We’re going to talk about dplyr more next week, but I wanted to include this function here. This function shows you the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
