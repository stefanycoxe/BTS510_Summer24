# Learning objectives

## Learning objectives

* Review the course topics, structure, and goals
* Start using **R** and **Rstudio**
* Start using [R markdown documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) as a **reproducible** method to present analyses along with **narrative text**

# Course topics and goals

## What is statistics? **Interdisciplinary**

- Mathematics
- Probability
- Uncertainty
- Programming / computer science
- Integrated into science

## What is statistics? **People solving problems**

- William Sealy Gosset
  - Guinness Brewing Company: Making better beer
  - $t$-distribution and $t$-test 
  
- Ronald Fisher
  - Rothamsted Experimental Station: Agricultural questions
  - Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and $F$-distribution
  - Popularized the $p$-value and $p < .05$ as a cut-off

## What is statistics? **Context**

## What is statistics? **Context**

- This thing is *8 feet tall*. **Is that tall?**
  - For a person: Yes
  - For a building: No

- These two things are *12 inches different* in height. **Is that a lot?**
  - For people: Yes
  - For buildings: No

## When to think about statistics?

<ul>
- Study design

- Data collection

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}  
- Data analysis  
:::  

- Interpretation
</ul>

. . .

> Ronald Fisher: \ 
To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of.

## Topics

- Reading in and manipulating data in R
- Making plots in R
- Descriptive statistics
- Probability, sampling distributions, uncertainty
- Comparing 2 means or proportions
- Controlling for multiple comparisons
- Comparing 3 or more means

## What you'll learn about

- Programming (in R)
- Probability and mathematics underlying statistical methods
- Conducting (some) statistical analyses
- Presenting results of statistical analyses
- Thinking about issues in science related to statistics

# R and Rstudio

## What is R?

- Free, open source software
  - Windows, Mac, Unix, cloud
- Object-oriented programming language
- Built-in capabilities ("packages")
- Users can write their own packages and functions

## What is R?

![](r.jpg)

## What does "object-oriented" mean?

- Programming built on the idea of "objects"
- Everything is an object
  - If you have an object's *name*, you can do something with it
- Objects: Datasets, variables, analyses, plots

## What does "object-oriented" mean?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x <- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
x
```

- Line 1
  - Define an **object** called `x` that is this set of numbers 
  - `<-` is the assignment operator
- Line 2
  - Print the object `x`  

## What is a function?

- Pre-written piece of code that 
  - Takes **one or more inputs** (or arguments)
  - Produces **one or more outputs**

## What is a function?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(x)
```

- Input: `x`
- Output: mean of `x`

[Documentation for `mean()` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/mean)

## What is a package?

- Collection of functions (that work together in some way)
  - **dplyr** package is a set of functions to manipulate data
  - **ggplot** package is a set of functions to create plots
  - **stats** package (built-in) is a set of functions to perform basic statistical operations
  
## What is a package?

- To use functions in a package, you need to
  - **Install** the package
    - *Just once* per machine / Rstudio 
  - **Load** or `library()` the package
    - *Every time* you use it

## What is Rstudio?

- Integrated development environment (IDE) for **R**
- Graphical user interface to use **R**
  - Manage installed packages
  - Connect to git / github
  - Easily see loaded datasets

# R markdown

## What is "markdown"?

- "Markup" language to format plain text
  - HTML: hyper-text markup language
- Headings, links, italics / bold, bullet points, equations
- Output final, formatted document into multiple formats
  - HTML, Word, PDF documents or slides
- Used across a wide variety of platforms, not just in **R**
  - Github, Jekyll, note-taking apps

## markdown example

![](dillinger.avif)

[https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#kicking-the-tires](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#kicking-the-tires)

## **rmarkdown** package

- Implements markdown in **R**
- Lets you create several document types
  - HTML or PDF or Word documents
  - Slides in HTML or PDF or Powerpoint
- Does all the heavy lifting to convert your markdown document to the final, formatted version

## What about Quarto?

- "Next gen" of markdown
- Works with multiple languages (even in the same document): R, Python, Julia
- Additional features
- Additional installation burden (and bugs!)
